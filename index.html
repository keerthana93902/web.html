    Tailor your experience sections to the job description.Don't use up too much of your space detailing<br> daily duties that aren't relevant to the job for which you're applying.Study the job listing to figure out<br>what's most important to the hiring manager.Use important resume keywords and accomplishments<br>that speak to your ability to execute.

<h3><strong>Company 3, Location</strong><br/>
<em>Job Title</em></h3>
Work the hard skills and keywords found in the job description right into your resume.Continue to add<br>context that proves that you actually possess the skill. For example, if you mention a piece of software<br>like Exel, Photoshop, or AutoCAD,mention the types of projects it was used for.

<em>Job Title</em></h4>
Recruiters like to be able to get an idea of why you move from company to company.Demonstrating<br>your increasingimpact and responsibility from job to job shows the recruiter that you're capable of<br>.taking on more and more and gives them an idea of where your career is heading.

<em>Job Title</em></h5>
You don't need to include every job youv'e ever had on resume. Stick to the jobs that are most<br>relevant and demonstrate your career trajectory. For example, if you are a Project Manager,you<br>probably don't need to mention  the supermarket job you had as a teenager.
